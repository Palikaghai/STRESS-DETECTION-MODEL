# STRESS-DETECTION-MODEL
* Stress has emerged as one of the most pressing mental health challenges of the 21st century, affecting individuals across all age groups, socio economic backgrounds, and professions. 
According to the American Psychological Association, chronic stress contributes to depression, anxiety disorders, cardiovascular disease, and weakened immune function. With the exponential growth of social media platforms and online support communities, individuals increasingly express their emotions, struggles, and personal experiences through written text. 
This shift presents a unique opportunity to leverage machine learning and natural language processing techniques to automatically detect stress signals from the language people use online.
